        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>
          Snake... why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg and my arm... even my fingers... the body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting. 
          It's like they're all still there. You feel it too, don't you? I'm the one who got caught up with Cipher. A group above nations... even the US. 
          And I was the parasite below, feeding off Zero's power. They came after you in Cyprus... then Afghanistan... Cipher... just keeps growing. 
          Swallowing everything in it's path. Getting bigger and bigger... Who knows how big now? Boss. 
          I'm gonna make 'em give back our past... take back everything that we've lost. And I won't rest... until we do.
